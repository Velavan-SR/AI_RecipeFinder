# Backend API URL
# For local development, use the proxy configured in vite.config.ts
# For production, use your deployed backend URL
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api

# Note: The frontend uses Vite's proxy by default in development
# You only need to set VITE_API_URL when deploying to production
